**Abstract**  
This doctoral thesis addresses the exploration and formal modelling of socio-ecological and techno-cultural patterns, as well as some of the hypothetical mechanisms that would explain them. The patterns are posited on two types of archaeological evidence: the **productions of ceramic containers** and the **agropastoral use of the territory**. The mechanisms dealt with are included in the general themes of **cultural transmission and evolution**, **exchange**, **competition** and **cooperation**. The thesis is the result of the combination of the generalist and interdisciplinary profile of the doctoral student and the opportunities offered by his participation in three research projects (SimulPast, 2011-2017, CAMOTECCER, 2013-2016, and CERAC, 2017-2020). In spite of obtaining its inspiration in the documented trajectory of the human occupation of the Surkhan Daria basin, Uzbekistan, the evidence is collected within the wide geographical context of the arid Afro-Eurasia. Likewise, data for multiple periods are referenced, from the Bronze Age to the present, with special emphasis between 500 BC and 500 AD.

The corpus of the thesis is divided into two methodological lines, *analysis of archaeometric data of ceramics* and *simulation of socio-ecological systems*, both framed at the intersection of *quantitative archaeology* with *digital archaeology*. Specifically, it addresses: *the differences between ceramic individuals, in terms of archaeometric data, for the detection of relationships of exchange and cultural change*, using multivariate statistical methods; *the emergence and stability of borders between nomadic and semi-nomadic pastoralism and sedentary agriculture*, using agent-based modelling; and *the conditions for cooperation for the storage of food in small-scale societies*, also using agent-based modelling.

This thesis contains text in three languages: Spanish, English, and Catalan. While the two introductory chapters and the conclusions were written in Spanish, the articles that make up the main corpus are in their original English version. All the chapters open with a summary in the three languages and all the articles have their summary translated into Spanish and Catalan. Exceptionally, the chapter on conclusions is offered in all three languages.
